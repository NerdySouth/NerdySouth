# Hi There!

My name is Tristen (Any/All), and I am a Masters student in Computer Science at Stanford University with a focus in systems and security. I also studied Computer Science for my Bachelors at Stanford University.
Right now, I am working within the Robust Systems Group at Stanford as a research assistant.

I am most interested in Operating Systems, safety and security in systems programming, Computer Architecture, and FOSS. In my free time, I like to tinker with stuff. Recently, that has been my own custom keyboard.

Outside of tech, I enjoy spending time with my two dogs, watching anime, and being out in nature.

🔭 I’m currently working on Ferrous, I want to explore how Rust's idioms can be used to provide not only a better shell experience, but do so safely and with ergonomic development for the project.

Here are some cool links I found:

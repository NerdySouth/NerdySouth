# Hi There!

My name is Tristen (Any/All), and I am a Masters student in Computer Science at Stanford University with a focus in systems and security. I also studied Computer Science for my Bachelors at Stanford University.
Most recently, I interned at Gridspace in Los Angeles, and am currently open to internship and part-time positions.

I am most interested in Operating Systems, Programming Languages, safety and security in systems programming, and FOSS. In my free time I enjoy working on
bare metal projects for ARMv8-A, and hacking on my personal shell, ferrous.

Outside of tech, I enjoy spending time with my two dogs, watching anime, and being out in nature.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Ferrous, I want to explore how Rust's idioms can be used to provide not only a better shell experience, but do so safely and with ergonomic development for the project.

Here are some cool links I found:

# Hi There!

My name is Tristen (Any/All), and I am a senior undergaduate at Stanford University studying Computer Science with a focus in systems and security.
Most recently, I interned at Gridspace in Los Angeles, and am currently open to full time new grad positions.

I am most interested in Operating Systems, Programming Languages, safety and security in systems programming, and FOSS. In my free time I enjoy working on
Nox and Zoot, two bare metal projects for ARMv8-A, currently supporting the Pine RockPro64 SBC. Check out the repositories for more info!

Outside of tech, I enjoy spending time with my two dogs, watching anime, and being out in nature.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Zoot, which i envision to be a type 1 hypervisor for the ARM architecture to enable more people to take advantage of ARM based SBC (Small Board Computers) for things like home media servers, home network storage solutions, self-hosted private communications, and more. I want Zoot to turn any ARM SBC into a secure and capable board for running all sorts of systems like KVM based instances, to plain old linux. I also just want to learn a lot more about the design and implementation of a type 1 hypervisor, the ARM arch, and Zig. 
bare metal development.

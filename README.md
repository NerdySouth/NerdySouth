# Hi There!

My name is Tristen (Any/All), and I am a senior undergaduate at Stanford University studying Computer Science with a focus in systems and security.
Most recently, I interned at Gridspace in Los Angeles, and am currently open to full time new grad positions.

I am most interested in Operating Systems, Programming Languages, safety and security in systems programming, and FOSS. In my free time I enjoy working on
Nox and Zoot, two bare metal projects for ARMv8-A, currently supporting the Pine RockPro64 SBC. Check out the repositories for more info!

Outside of tech, I enjoy spending time with my two dogs, watching anime, and being out in nature.

Here are some cool links I found:
